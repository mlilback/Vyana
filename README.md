# Vyana
A framework of classes for use in OS X and iOS development.

This a megolith framework whose origins start in 2003 and likely earlier. Every reusable class I (Mark Lilback) made over the years was added to it. Most are no longer used and many show evidence of poor design patterns. However, with Agile Monks being shutdown, open sourcing them was the best solution I could find for future projects and existing projects I worked on at WVU to continue using them.

The 3rdparty.tbz2 archive contains the source for bcrypt_objc, which is used in Vyana. Just expand it to build the framework.
